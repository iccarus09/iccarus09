# Hi! I am AmeliaðŸ‘‹
### I'm a digital noob on a journey to becoming a craftsman, creating things I couldn't find elsewhere. I love the creativity and freedom that coding brings. As I'm still in the learning phase, some of my code might be a bit rough around the edges, but I hope you'll enjoy seeing my progress.
